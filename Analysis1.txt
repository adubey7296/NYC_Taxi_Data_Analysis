Q.1) Compare the average fare for November and December.

	select month(tpep_pickup_datetime) as month, round(avg(fare_amount),2) as average_fare from yellow_trip_data_final_s3
	where fare_amount>0
	group by month(tpep_pickup_datetime);
	
Q.2) Explore the ‘number of passengers per trip’ - how many trips are made by each level of ‘Passenger_count’? Do most people travel solo or with other people?

	select passenger_count, count(*) as counts from yellow_trip_data_final_s3 
	where passenger_count!=0
	group by passenger_count
	order by passenger_count;
	
Q.3) Which is the most preferred mode of payment?

	select payment_type, count(*) as counts from yellow_trip_data_final_s3
	group by payment_type
	order by payment_type;

Q.4) What is the average tip paid? Compare the average tip with the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles and comment 
   whether the ‘average tip’ is a representative statistic (of the central tendency) of ‘tip amount paid’.
   
	select round(avg(tip_amount),2) as average, round(percentile_approx(tip_amount, 0.25),2) as 25th_percentile, 
	round(percentile_approx(tip_amount ,0.50),2) as 50th_percentile, round(percentile_approx(tip_amount ,0.75),2) as 75th_percentile
	from yellow_trip_data_final_s3
	where tip_amount>=0;
	/*-- average_tip is higher than the 50th percentile, so it's not a representative statistic (of the central tendency) of ‘tip amount paid’--*/
	
Q.5) Explore the ‘Extra’ (charge) variable - what is the fraction of total trips where an extra charge is levied?

 	SELECT round(SUM( IF( extra == 0.0, 0 , 1 ) )/ COUNT(*) * 100,2) as total_trips_percentage_with_extra_charge
	FROM yellow_trip_data_final_s3;
